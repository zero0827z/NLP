occasional pats of butter,,, mmmm,,,!/THE BUFFET AT BELLAGIO WAS FAR FROM WHAT I ANTICIPATED,/and the drinks are weak, people!/-MY ORDER WAS NOT CORRECT,/also, i feel like the chips are bought, not made in house,/AFTER THE DISAPPOINTING DINNER WE WENT ELSEWHERE FOR DESSERT,/the chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!/WE WON\\'T BE RETURNING,/this is my new fav vegas buffet spot,/I SERIOUSLY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE OWNER HAS SO MANY UNEXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES THAT ALL ARE RUNNING AROUND LIKE CHICKENS WITH THEIR HEADS CUT OFF,/very, very sad,/I FELT INSULTED AND DISRESPECTED, HOW

HALF OF A GLASS WINE FULL AND WAS $12, RIDICULOUS,/don\\'t bother coming here,/THE MEAT WAS PRETTY DRY, I HAD THE SLICED BRISKET AND PULLED PORK,/the building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but i wouldn\\'t eat here again,/IT WAS EQUALLY AWFUL,/probably not in a hurry to go back,/VERY SLOW AT SEATING EVEN WITH RESERVATION,/not good by any stretch of the imagination,/THE CASHEW CREAM SAUCE WAS BLAND AND THE VEGETABLES WERE UNDERCOOKED,/the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat,/IT WAS A BIT TOO SWEET, NOT REALLY SPICY ENOUGH, AND LACKED FLAVOR,/i was very disappointed!!/THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE AND WAY OVERPRICED,/maybe it\\'s just their vegetarian fare, but i\\'ve been twice and i thought it was average at best,/IT WASN\\'T BUSY AT ALL AND NOW WE KNOW WHY,/the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu,/THE AMBIANCE HERE DID NOT FEEL LIKE A BUFFET SETTING, BUT MORE OF A DOUCHEY INDOOR GARDEN FOR TEA AND BISCUITS,/con: spotty service,/THE FRIES WERE NOT HOT, AND NEITHER WAS MY BURGER,/but then they came back cold,/THEN OUR FOOD CAME OUT, DISAPPOINTMENT ENSUED,/the real disappointment was our waiter,/MY HUSBAND SAID SHE WAS VERY RUDE,,, DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR THE BAD FOOD OR ANYTHING,/the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach,/INSULTS, PROFOUND DEUCHEBAGGERY, AND HAD TO GO OUTSIDE FOR A SMOKE BREAK WHILE SERVING JUST TO SOLIDIFY IT,/if someone orders two tacos don\\'t\\' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?/SHE WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED ALTHOUGH SOME BLAME NEEDS TO BE PLACED AT HER DOOR,/after all the rave reviews i couldn\\'t wait to eat here,,,,,,what a disappointment!/DEL TACO IS PRETTY NASTY AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE,/it\\'s not hard to make a decent hamburger,/BUT I DON\\'T LIKE IT,/hell no will i go back/WE\\'VE HAVE GOTTEN A MUCH BETTER SERVICE FROM THE PIZZA PLACE NEXT DOOR THAN THE SERVICES WE RECEIVED FROM THIS RESTAURANT,/i don\\'t know what the big deal is about this place, but i won\\'t be back \"ya\\'all\",/I IMMEDIATELY SAID I WANTED TO TALK TO THE MANAGER BUT I DID NOT WANT TO TALK TO THE GUY WHO WAS DOING SHOTS OF FIREBALL BEHIND THE BAR,/the ambiance isn\\'t much better,/UNFORTUNATELY, IT ONLY SET US UP FOR DISAPPPOINTMENT WITH OUR ENTREES,/the food wasn\\'t good,/YOUR SERVERS SUCK, WAIT, CORRECTION, OUR SERVER HEIMER SUCKED,/what happened next was pretty,,,,off putting,/TOO BAD CAUSE I KNOW IT\\'S FAMILY OWNED, I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE,/overpriced for what you are getting,/I VOMITED IN THE BATHROOM MID LUNCH,/i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food,/I HAVE BEEN TO VERY FEW PLACES TO EAT THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I EVER RETURN TO, AND THIS TOPS THE LIST,/we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh,/FOOD WAS BELOW AVERAGE,/it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant,/ALL IN ALL, HA LONG BAY WAS A BIT OF A FLOP,/the problem i have is that they charge $11,99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables),/SHRIMP- WHEN I UNWRAPPED IT (I LIVE ONLY 1/2 A MILE FROM BRUSHFIRE) IT WAS LITERALLY ICE COLD,/it lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry,/IT REALLY IS IMPRESSIVE THAT THE PLACE HASN\\'T CLOSED DOWN,/i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage,/THE REFRIED BEANS THAT CAME WITH MY MEAL WERE DRIED OUT AND CRUSTY AND THE FOOD WAS BLAND,/spend your money and time some place else,/A LADY AT THE TABLE NEXT TO US FOUND A LIVE GREEN CATERPILLAR IN HER SALAD,/the presentation of the food was awful,/I CAN\\'T TELL YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED I WAS,/i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking,/APPETITE INSTANTLY GONE,/overall i was not impressed and would not go back,/THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS UNDERWHELMING, AND I THINK WE\\'LL JUST GO TO NINJA SUSHI NEXT TIME,/then, as if i hadn\\'t wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check,'"
